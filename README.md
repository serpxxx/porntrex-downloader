## Why PornTrex Downloader

PornTrex pages often expose their media through player configurations and stream URLs that are awkward to save manually. Generic downloaders can miss the real source, pull a preview instead of the main video, or fail once the page switches playback methods.

PornTrex Downloader is built to simplify that workflow. Open the watch page, let the extension detect the stream, choose the quality you want, and export the final file as MP4 without extra software.

## Features

- Detects supported PornTrex video sources from watch pages
- Multi-source detection covering flashvars, HTML5 video, and CDN monitoring
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Handles direct MP4 and supported HLS-backed playback flows
- Converts HLS streams to standard MP4 files in-browser
- Lists available quality variants when multiple resolutions exist
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Saves output as MP4 for broad playback compatibility
- Auto-saves to an organized PornTrex subfolder in Downloads
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open a PornTrex video page and start playback.
3. Let the extension detect the active media source.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button on the player.
5. Review the available formats and quality options.
6. Pick the quality you want.
7. Download the video and save the MP4 locally.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Videos from PornTrex

1. Install PornTrex Downloader from the release page or product page.
2. Open PornTrex and navigate to the video you want to save.
3. Press play so the page loads the real media stream.
4. Click the in-page download button on the player, or open the extension popup.
5. Wait for the stream list to appear and review the available options.
6. Choose the resolution you want if more than one option is available.
7. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
8. Open the saved file from your Downloads/PornTrex folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported PornTrex watch-page video sources
- Output: MP4

Saved files use MP4 so they are easier to replay on standard media players, move between devices, or archive locally.

## Who It's For

- PornTrex viewers who want offline access
- Users archiving videos they are allowed to save
- People who want a browser tool instead of stream extraction scripts
- Users who need a simple repeatable workflow for one-off downloads
- Anyone organizing personal downloads into a cleaner local library

## Common Use Cases

- Save a PornTrex video before it disappears
- Keep a local MP4 copy for offline viewing
- Grab the highest available quality from a watch page
- Start downloads directly from the player or extension popup
- Avoid manually inspecting page scripts for media URLs

## Troubleshooting

**The extension is not detecting the video**  
Start playback first and wait a few seconds so the page loads the stream.

**The wrong source was detected**  
Refresh the page, press play again, and retry after the player fully loads.

**No quality picker is shown**
Some pages expose only one usable source. In that case, the extension uses the available stream.

**The download failed partway through**
Check your connection and refresh the page before starting again.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.

Yes. The extension exports supported videos as MP4 files.

Yes. Video processing happens entirely in your browser. Authentication uses secure OTP with no passwords stored.
